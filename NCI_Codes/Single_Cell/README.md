This project includes workflows for preprocessing, normalization, integration, clustering, and cell type annotation of melanoma and lung single-cell RNA-seq data. Individual samples were analyzed using SCTransform without integration, while merged datasets were normalized using either log/library normalization or SCTransform and integrated using Harmony to correct for batch effects. Clustering was performed at multiple resolutions, followed by visualization of primary marker genes and manual cluster annotation. Final outputs include annotated Seurat objects, UMAP plots, and QC/marker expression plots.
