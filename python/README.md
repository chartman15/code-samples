DNA_sequence_processing.py: DNA Sequence Analysis & Bioinformatics Utilities

This repository contains a Python script that implements several foundational bioinformatics operations.
The script is divided into five modules (Questions 1–5), each addressing a different computational task involving DNA sequences, restriction enzymes, FASTA parsing, codon usage, and population modeling.

Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder & Homology Analysis

This Python script provides tools for identifying Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in DNA sequences from FASTA files and performing simple pairwise homology scoring between ORFs.
It handles sequences on both forward and reverse complement strands and allows filtering ORFs based on a minimum length.
